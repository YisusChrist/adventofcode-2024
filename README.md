# 📜 About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual event featuring daily programming puzzles from December 1st to December 25th. It's a fantastic way to hone problem-solving skills, explore algorithms, and compete with friends or the global leaderboard!

# 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each day's challenge is stored in a subfolder (dayXX/), containing:

- `input.txt`: The puzzle input for the day.
- `solution.py`: My solution in Python (might expand to other languages later).
